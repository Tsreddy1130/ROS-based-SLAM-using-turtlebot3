To load the burger robot export the burger as turtlebot3_model 

-->export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

Next lauch the gazebo world  with  burger robot with in it

--> roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch

For controling the movement of the robot we use teleop key node:

-->roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

(#NOTE make sure to export your turtlenot3_model before perfoing any launch)


Run SLAM Node:
run the slam node in the other termial 

-->roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping

Now rviz(ros visualization ) tool open for mapping.explore your evironment every space 
to get cleaar mapping for localization



After completely exploring the environment save you map using map saver node

-->rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map

make sure the file map.yaml file saved in home folder

Run Navigation Node:

-->roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml
